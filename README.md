# Creganography

Using a multilevel approach, the main objective of this project is to provide high
level security to sensitive digital data against steganalysis techniques, while keeping the
operational time low. This objective can be achieved by encrypting and authenticating the
image that has userâ€™s sensitive data and then embedding the resultant document on to a
carrier.

## This code has been implemented using python and some modules like opencv and tqdm might needs to be explicitly installed before executing this code.
